This is a simple theme component that adds a scroll to top button in the lower left corner when you scroll down a page. It's a much quicker and easier way to get to the top rather than using the timeline in my opinion. It only displays once you scroll down the page.

**How do I install this theme component?**

Follow the [theme installation guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682) and add the theme component to your active themes.

If you're new to Discourse themes, you can learn more about them [here.](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-using-discourse-themes/91966)

**Limitations**
If you visit a long post and you didn't start at the beginning (viewing the latest unread post for example), it will not scroll all the way to the top because the entire page is not loaded.

This is my first theme component so the I'm sure the code is a bit sloppy compared to most. PR's welcome to help improve it!
