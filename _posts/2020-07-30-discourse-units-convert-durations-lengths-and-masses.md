# Discourse Units

`discourse-units` is a theme component that automatically detects and converts durations, lengths and masses between various scales to make them easier to comprehend.

Example:

![units_length: 652x260, 50%](/images/149360/6jIej1u3UELVcX6OlK14xUNYa2p.png)  ![units_duration: 652x260, 50%](/images/149360/viDPjrd5z3lTrnBCkWpQAZMQexJ.png)
