A theme component that helps distinguish team whispers, team categories, and moderator posts (not for aesthetic reasons, but to help avoid mistakes):

https://github.com/chrisbeach/discourse-team-tweaks

* Team categories have a light orange header colour
* Whispers have a light orange background colour
* Whisper reply buttons coloured orange and labelled with "reply as whisper" to distinguish from regular reply buttons
* When posting as moderator, avatar is shown with gold ring, and ", moderator" is added to title
