## Motivation
Tweak the general layout of the https://meta.discourse.org/t/daemonite-material-theme/64521 towards slightly bolder appearance, mainly by using larger font sizes and element dimensions. On the other hand, decrease some font sizes to optimize display for mobile.

## Background
This was spawned while working on implementing the https://meta.discourse.org/t/daemonite-material-theme/64521 on another Discourse instance the other day. While it's only some minor amendments to CSS, we just wrapped it up and packaged it to help others with similar requirements. Also, it might spawn a discussion about whether and how to incorporate this into the core theme.
