# Bugs: a Discourse theme-component

Did you know fruit flies were the first living creatures to be sent into space? Spiders are found on every continent of the world except Antarctica üï∑

This theme component is a port and update of Auzbugs repo. It originally started out as an April fools joke and has been adapted over time. I've included a new bugs interact feature in this component.

This is just a bit of fun :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :  I suggest you use it sparingly, maybe just at Halloween :ghost: or to play a joke on someone you know :nerd_face:. You can target it at specific groups and users in the theme settings. 

I personally like to have a little bug friend on screen to keep me company :ant: I swat him away if he starts to bug me! Yes you can exterminate  them üíÄ üò≥

:thinking: [How do I install a Theme or Theme Component?](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682)

## Settings

I‚Äôve included some options in the theme settings. These include making it show only to specific users and groups. 

There are a couple of methods that you can use to allow users to turn it on and off. 

[details=‚ÄúCreate a user selectable bugs group‚Äù]

By creating a group you can allow users to join and leave at their will. 

Set up a group called e.g. Bugs. In the group settings allow them to join and leave freely.

This will give them these options before they join and after.

Remember to set the theme setting so the group will see the bugs!

[details="Convert the component into a user selectable theme‚Äú]

To make this theme component user selectable you can covert it to a theme. To do that click the Convert button at the bottom of the theme settings.

Once it is a theme make it user selectable, select the light color palate and include any other components you have installed. You can also rename it if you prefer.

If you have the [theme selector component](https://meta.discourse.org/t/hamburger-theme-selector/61210) installed users can then toggle their themes on the site menu.
