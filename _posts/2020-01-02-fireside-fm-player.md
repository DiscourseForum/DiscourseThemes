## Using this Theme Component

### Settings

- `fireside src url`: This is where you paste in your fireside.fm latest player `src` URL, which is found on your podcast's admin dashboard.

- `fireside player location`: This component allows you to add the player in one of three locations --
  - Below global notices, which displays on every page
  - Above the topic post stream, displaying above every topic
  - Above suggested topics
- `display on mobile`: The mobile experience of the podcast player is variable due to its use of an iframe, so mobile display is off by default.
