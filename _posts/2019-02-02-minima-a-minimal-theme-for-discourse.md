The goal of this theme is to reduce the UI and focus on the text.

I've gone through and made text larger and removed just about anything redundant (and anything that I don't use regularly). For example, I know that suggested topics are suggested topics, so I removed the header. I've used bulk select on the topic list maybe twice ever, so it's gone. Views on the topic list? gone. Categories in the hamburger menu? gone. 

You get the idea, here's the theme.

For extra minimalness, I recommend using the `Categories Only` layout for the category page.
