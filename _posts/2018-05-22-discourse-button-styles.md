There are 6 button sets that can be styled in this component, along with a global style for adding rounded corners to all buttons (border-radius): 

* basic buttons
* primary buttons
* header buttons
* nav pills
* post controls
* editor buttons

For advanced button styling you may also consider looking at the `common.scss` file as a starting point for your custom CSS. In the future I'll be using what I learned here to reduce the number of CSS styles required to style buttons in Discourse (and I'll maintain/simplify this theme as I go).
