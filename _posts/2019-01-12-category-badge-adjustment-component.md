## Motivation
Tweak the style of the category badges.

## Background
This was spawned while working on implementing the https://meta.discourse.org/t/daemonite-material-theme/64521 on another Discourse instance the other day. While it's only a pretty minor amendment to CSS, we just wrapped it up, added appropriate settings and packaged it.

## Features
- Optionally adjust `border-radius` css attribute of category badges
  to give them a more flat / less globular appearance.
- Optionally prevent shrinked badges on e.g. `/latest`.
- Optionally emphasize category label.

**Note**: We know this style might deviate from the official [Google Material Design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design) which is pretty straight on https://material.io/design/components/chips.html, but nevertheless we find this look more pleasant. Please enjoy it as a language dialect.
