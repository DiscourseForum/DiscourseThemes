I really liked the [theme shared way back in 2016](https://meta.discourse.org/t/a-graceful-style-for-discourse/43429) by @jsthon :heart_eyes:. They haven't been around since it was initially posted, so I've updated it, expanded it, and added it to github.

This theme has two settings: 

* A field to add your own background image 
* and the option to tile it 

If you disable the tile option, the image will be set to `background-size: cover`, and your browser will scale your image to proportionately cover the full background. For example:
