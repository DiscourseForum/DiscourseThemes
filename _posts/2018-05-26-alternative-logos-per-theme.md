This is a theme component that will allow you to add alternative logos on a per-theme basis. 

> :warning: Since August 2020, Discourse core supports uploading dark theme logo alternatives in core. See https://meta.discourse.org/t/automatic-dark-mode-color-scheme-switching/161593 for details on how to set that up without this component. 

The effects of this theme are purely visual. All functionality is intact / unchanged.

#### Samples 

To demonstrate what this theme does, here's an example. 

Let's say this is your logo

![1067cac7af32755cb4fadd3af75a13c6: 690x276, 10%](/images/88502/ia7q7lcsr0Z0ahsQp3AN9oJ70lr.png)

You add it in your site settings or via the wizard and it looks like this

![Capture: 690x56, 70%](/images/88502/kUwYx7ehn316R3o3AMONfjDug3F.PNG)

However, let's say you want to also allow your users to be able to use a dark theme. Here's what happens

![Capture2: 690x59, 70%](/images/88502/yjCyEf6RzIRxn1HY9dnQfLaDozJ.PNG)

The same goes with the small logo that shows up when you scroll and the mobile logo. 

This theme attempts to address the issue by adding three theme settings that you can use to override the logos on a per-theme basis:

The end result is something like this:

You keep the default logo in themes which don't have this component:

![Capture: 690x56, 70%](/images/88502/kUwYx7ehn316R3o3AMONfjDug3F.PNG)

While being able to override it in themes that do have this component added:
