This is a theme component that will allow you to easily change the :heart: icon with the :+1: icon  (or any other [font awesome 5.5 glyph](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) you prefer).
Please, remember also that:
[quote="pmusaraj, post:1, topic:101643"]
- since the Font Awesome icon set has grown to 1300+ icons in version 5, we have built an internal API that delivers to clients a subset of all FA icons, that is, only those icons used by that Discourse instance
[/quote]
 and that
[quote="pmusaraj, post:1, topic:101643"]
- site administrators can also use a new site setting called `svg icon subset` to register their chosen icons and add them to their siteâ€™s subset

Remember that you can change also:
-  _color_ through `/admin/customize/colors/` 
- _text_ through `/admin/customize/site_texts/`

Install it as a [theme component](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682)  and add the component to your main theme(s).
