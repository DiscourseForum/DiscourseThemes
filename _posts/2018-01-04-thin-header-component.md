#### Samples

Before

![Default Discourse header: 690x66](/images/77220/wmaDoI6Mb69KmgsdxKpFjspxnNj.png) 
After

![Modified Discourse header: 690x67](/images/77220/75ISAyWpHXco8RZh8P7F2asiXKB.png) 

It reduces the header height by about 50% by not showing the topic category / tags. The results on mobile are similar to what you see above. All the changes are purely visual and the rest of the header functionality remains unchanged.
