I think we can all use a bit of an escape this week, so I've built a theme based on one of my favorite game series: [Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing). This one is specifically inspired by [Pocket Camp](https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/site)'s interface. 

This theme features calm earthy colors, rounded corners, and chunky buttons.

There's still a little more refinement to be done, and I'd like to add some fun background pattern options... but I'm sharing this today to celebrate the release of [New Horizons](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/). :heart:
