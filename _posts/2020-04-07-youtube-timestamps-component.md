* https://discuss.bevry.me/t/maps-of-meaning-9/31/2?u=balupton (has things like  `5:1` ,  `11:1`  that are correctly not timestamped)
* https://discuss.bevry.me/t/maps-of-meaning-8/30/2?u=balupton (has a link to a referenced youtube video inside the notes, hence usage of  `# my notes for [associated youtube video](...)`  to make sure correct youtube video is associated)
* https://discuss.bevry.me/t/ep-4-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-socrates-and-the-quest-for-wisdom/832/3?u=balupton (standard, associated to topic youtube video)
