This theme lets you set a background image and a welcome youtube video for the login / signup page on a private Discourse.

@Martin_Cole a new member of our meta community, sponsored the development of this theme for [Learning to Trade forum](https://forum.learningtotrade.com).

The theme has 5 settings.

It uses the same "lazy loading" that Discourse uses to load youtube videos in posts.
