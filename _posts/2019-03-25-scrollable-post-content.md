### Settings

This theme comes with two settings:

1. **Content height**

   this allows you to set the desired height of the scrollable content in pixels. It defaults to 300. If you want to change it, just add a number, no need for units.

2. **Scrollable content button icon**

    this allows you to set the icon used for the scrollable content button in the composer. 

### Translations

The component comes with one string that you can translate. 

`insert_scrollable_content: Insert scrollable content`

This acts as the label for the composer button.

### How do I use it?

There are two ways to add scrollable content.

1. highlight the content you want to target, then click the button in the composer.
2. click the composer button and start typing / paste content.

Either way works so it's up to you.
