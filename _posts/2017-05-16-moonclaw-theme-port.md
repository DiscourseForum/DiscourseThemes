I got around to porting an old favorite phpbb theme this weekend for my forum, for nostalgia's sake. I've cleaned it up and thought I'd share it here - Let me know what you guys think!

Installation: Add `https://github.com/featheredtoast/discourse-moonclaw-theme` to your themes, and picking "Moonclaw" as your color scheme. Colors aren't yet customizable just yet, as many have been hardcoded to get this out the door quickly.
