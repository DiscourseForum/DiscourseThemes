Until recently, categories displayed in the topic lists as a column. [After discussing its usefulness](/t/the-topic-list-doesnt-need-a-category-column/101352), the dedicated column for categories seemed excessive and it was removed in favor of placing the category under the topic title. There is plenty to gain from this change (see the above linked topic for details), however, some have voiced that they prefer having the category column. This component is for those that may be struggling with the changes.
