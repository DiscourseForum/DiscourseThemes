# MD Topic List Mobile
----

After my work on a little redesign on the [topic list pages on desktop](https://meta.discourse.org/t/md-topic-list-component/117694), I worked a bit on a mobile version with some similar ideas like a bigger room for the titles of the topics, a second line with more information and a column dedicated only to the last post.

## Compatibility

This theme component is compatible with the tags, featured links functions, and any functions available in the [original topic-list version ](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/discourse/templates/list/topic-list-item.raw.hbs). Any category style presentation (bullet, bar, box) should work with this component.

The theme component has been tested on a few color palettes, it will work with light, neutral or dark themes.

Sadly, the theme component might not work with plugins that already changes the topic-list presentation like the Topic List Previews.

Let me know if you have any issue !
