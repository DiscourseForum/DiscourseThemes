Well, @hellekin thought that this deserved its own topic. I'm not quite sure it's ready for such, but here it is. I'll have a look at stuff early next week and try to make sure that it looks like something that other people could really use. :wink:  

As he said:
[quote="hellekin, post:2, topic:152459"]
In the new https://meta.discourse.org/t/page-publishing/151971/19?u=hellekin topic, @pfaffman introduced a theme component that allows an admin to alter the default homepage of a Discourse instance to any URL. Since I could not find a related topic -- and the  "missing_url" in the `about.json` seems to confirm it does not exist yet, here it is!
