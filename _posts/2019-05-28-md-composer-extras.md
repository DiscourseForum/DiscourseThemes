## Compatibility
---

This theme component is an alternative of the [Discourse Formatting Toolbar](https://meta.discourse.org/t/formatting-toolbar/40649), **I don't recommend using both**.

I recommend the plugin, but if you don't want to (or can't) install a plugin, this theme component might add enough options in the composer for you.

Also, to adapt the the component in mobile devices, I hid some buttons : bullet list, list and justify. They seemed the less helpful in this device.

For RTL languages forums, here is the rtl version : https://github.com/iunctis/md-composer-extras-rtl

Let me know if there is some issue !

I used some work done by @Johani in his theme components to add translations of the elements, and auto-integration of fa5 icons.
