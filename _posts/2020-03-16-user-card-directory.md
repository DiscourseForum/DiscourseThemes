:thinking: [How do I install a Theme or Theme Component? ](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682)

:information_source: The required APIs were [added](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/ff62911a89d721ebec1716990c5e407e572d8960) to tests-passed on 6th March 2020, so make sure you have updated Discourse since then

Big thanks to @joebuhlig for [discourse-biobook](https://procourse.co/portfolio/discourse-biobook/), which inspired this work. And also @angus @fzngagan and @alxpck for prompting the various core improvements we needed to make this achievable.
