As Christmas approaches, you may want to add a bit of festive flair to your forum. So I present a (very simple) _Christmas hats_ theme:

A couple of notes:

* This theme assumes list avatars are 25x25 with a 2px border all round; you may need to tweak some of the positioning in the CSS for your avatars.
* It also assumes that thread avatars are 64x64 with a 2px border all round; again, tweak the positioning as you see fit.
* To avoid excessive festiveness, not all avatars in lists will be bedecked with Christmas cheer, but once you open up a thread, everyone is part of the fun.

Enjoy!
