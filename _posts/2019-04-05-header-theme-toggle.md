I've built a simple toggle for the header that switches between two themes on click.

In the theme component's settings, you can define the two themes:

:warning: **Please note**

* Both themes must have `Theme can be selected by users` enabled, and both themes must also have this theme component added.  

* The theme name is used in the toggle. I strongly recommend short names!

* I have not yet added mobile support, so this only works on desktop for now
