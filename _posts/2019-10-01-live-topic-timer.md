- The `rerender time` can be changed in the component settings according to your use case. 

- The time displayed by the timer can be format in multiple ways from the theme component setting whose documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/jsmreese/moment-duration-format#template).

## To do
- Display the timer on the header next to the topic title.
I’m looking for specific UI/UX suggestions for how to implement a header timer, in the context of Discourse, with a view to crowd-funding the development costs if there’s enough interest (@darhazer @tobiaseigen)
