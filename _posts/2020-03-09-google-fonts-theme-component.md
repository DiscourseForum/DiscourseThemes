This is a simple theme component that allows you to add a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) without writing any CSS.

This component allows you to set the main site font, and optionally separate fonts for headlines and monospaced text (code blocks). You can also choose a font weight in each case, and increase the overall font size.

Behind the scenes this sets up a little bit of CSS along with Google's font `<link>`. Note that this is relying on Google to serve the font files from `https://fonts.googleapis.com/`.
