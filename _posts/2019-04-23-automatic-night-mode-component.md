Following up the discussion here:

I made a theme component that will automatically switch to night theme based on user preferences. It's currently work on a per-browser basis.

### Installation

Add this component to each theme installed.

### Known Issues

- I've received a report of the component making all navigation cause full reloads. Upon navigating between different pages every click caused a full refresh instead of an in-app navigation. I have not been able to reproduce this, so please post reproduction steps if you run into this.

Feedback is welcome and thanks to Discourse team for sponsoring this work :)
