### What this does?

This theme component adds a composer button that simplifies adding videos with subtitles (VTT format), a poster image and multiple video sources to a Discourse post. 

Clicking the button triggers a modal window that allows uploading/linking the relevant files and then adds the appropriate HTML code in the composer:

(For uploads to work, you'll need to allow `.vtt` and your chosen video formats in the `authorized extensions` site setting.)
