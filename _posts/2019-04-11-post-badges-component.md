> :warning: As it currently stands, this component will make **one ajax request per loaded post**. This can add up depending on your hosting situation and community size, so please keep that in mind as you consider installing this component. It's clear that there is a good amount of interest in this feature, so we will be continuing to improve the situation as time permits. Stay tuned :slight_smile: 

This component will add earned badges next to a post author's username. Specific badges to display can be adjusted through a theme setting.

**Key features**

- Support for both default and custom badges.
- Hovering over the badge will show a tooltip with the badge's description.
- Clicking on the badge will take a user to the badge's overview page



**Usage tips**

- Some default badges contain links in their descriptions. These will not display nicely as a tooltip, so it is recommended to customize the description at `/admin/customize/site_texts`. You can find what you need to modify by searching for part of the description's current text.
