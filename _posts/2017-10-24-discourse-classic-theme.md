Remember 2013? The year of [Frozen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/), [Yeezus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeezus), [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass), and when Discourse looked like this:

Now you can relive the past with the Discourse Classic Theme :tada:

Unlike Discourse in 2013, The Discourse Classic theme supports desktop and mobile devices, multiple badge styles, and light/dark color schemes.

Feel free to import it to your own Discourse install, or try it out here on Meta by selecting it from the hamburger menu (also in your personal preferences under "interface"). 

Please report any bugs you may find, and let me know what you think!
