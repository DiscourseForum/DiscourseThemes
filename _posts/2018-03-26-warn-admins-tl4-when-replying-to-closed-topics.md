## [Admin Warnings Theme Component](https://github.com/davidtaylorhq/discourse-admin-warnings)
`https://github.com/davidtaylorhq/discourse-admin-warnings`

When admins click 'reply' on a closed topic, they will be warned. This helps to prevent admins accidentally continuing a closed/archived discussion (much to the frustration of other forum users!).
