Solves [Is there a way to suggest DuckDuckGo instead of Google for failed search UI?](https://meta.discourse.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-suggest-duckduckgo-instead-of-google-for-failed-search-ui/83895).

A Discourse theme component to use DuckDuckGo as the suggested search system, instead of Google!

p.s. You'll probably want to customize some of the text strings to stop mentioning Google, too.
