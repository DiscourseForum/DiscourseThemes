This is a simple component that will automatically add an emoji (or other text, if you'd like) to a  `@mention` in a post

## How to

To configure it, add items to the list in the format of `@username, emoji` (You can copy and paste emoji from https://getemoji.com/ or https://emojipedia.org/)

There's also an option to show the emoji after the mention, instead of before. 

That's all it does!
