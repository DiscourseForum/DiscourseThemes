I had a little fun with this one to showcase the flexibility of our theming system. This layout might look a bit familiar :wink: 

The theme features a navigation sidebar, as well as a sidebar that showcases some of your user profile information. If a topic has an image, the topic list shows a preview. Topic excerpts will be displayed on all topics.

In the theme settings you'll find a few options for hiding sidebar content, or switching the sidebar sides. 

I recommend using the "Categories Only" category page layout with this theme, as space in the main column very limited.
