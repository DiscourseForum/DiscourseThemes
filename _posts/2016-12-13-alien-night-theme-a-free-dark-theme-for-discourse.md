Hey guys,

> **After 2 years (scary), I finally got time to update this theme!**
**Over the time I developed a new theme based on that, which I migrated now to Alien Night.**
**I hope you like it!**


[Preview it on the Theme Creator page](https://theme-creator.discourse.org/theme/B-iggy/alien-night-theme)

I want to share a free dark theme for discourse called "**Alien Night**".
I made it for my server game community.

Since I have people from all over the world playing on my servers and reading the forum at any time I wanted to have a dark and a bright theme people can choose from. Especially the night one should be eye friendly in the night and reflect some specific colors we are generally using for HWS.

# Implemented Dark/Light switcher

I completely reworked the Theme Switcher this time - utilized it into the [Discourse Header](https://meta.discourse.org/t/custom-complex-html-code-in-the-discourse-header/113344/2?u=b-iggy)!

It was quite a challenge because I have to listen for the AjaxComplete refresh of Javascript (thanks to @Johani :) ) and listen for the dynamic Topic Header Scroll event, which also resets my custom Javascript. Check out the code and let me know if it's fine ;)  

It is done via local storage for an easy persistent usage.
