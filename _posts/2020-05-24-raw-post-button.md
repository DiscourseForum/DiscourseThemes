This is a theme component that will add a button to the post menu. When you click the button, you'll get a modal / popover with the the raw (markdown) version of the post.

#### Samples

![post menu button: 690x143, 75%](/images/152542/mRXwOqCabqkBkUry2ETk3EdS1sv.png)  

![raw modal: 535x500, 75%](/images/152542/35XLU75gzXcox3GPe6mHLzdP6ho.png)  

#### Settings

There's only one setting and that setting is `min_trust_level`

![trust level setting: 690x134, 50%](/images/152542/wpcAtXJ3v6vouQOKdaXxCcPIB8M.png) 

This setting allows you to set a minimum trust level the current user needs to have before they can see that button. It defaults to TL0. Anons will never see it.
