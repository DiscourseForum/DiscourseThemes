Installing this theme component will add a stopwatch to the top of a topic. A tag specified in the theme settings will establish which topics the stopwatch will appear.

<h4>Example:</h4>

![stopwatch-ex1: 690x247](/images/83939/jF5HAHHbTNycDBNLSpL39HFbHb2.png)

<h2>Settings</h2>

There are three settings. You must add a single tag name to associate with a stopwatch. In this example I use a tag called "speed-read."

**IMPORTANT: You must be running [Discourse Version 2.0.0.beta4](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-2-0-0-beta4-release-notes/82446) or later for this theme component to work.**

<h2>About</h2>

This theme component was inspired by the discussion found here:

https://meta.discourse.org/t/iframe-css-code-disable-scrolling-bar/83254

The usefulness of this theme component is very niche I imagine, but hopefully it will end up helping a few people either for what it is, or as example code.

Some ideas where it could be applied in a forum:

- Some type of quiz/test practice
- Speed-reading exercises
- Public speaking practice

As of now, it does not save the time after leaving the topic.
